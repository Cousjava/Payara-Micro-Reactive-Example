*Webapp* module is for the enduser and it delegatates time consuming coputation (simulated by `Thread.sleep`) to the *computation* module. *Reactive-base* module is just a shared library used by the 2 webapps

The communiction is implemented by *Payara CDI event bus*:

1. webapp sends a remote event to start computation and saves a lock object into distributed cache (using *JCache* in Payara)
2. first coputation module that receives the event will atomically remove the lock object and do the cmputation
3. all other computation modules that don't find the lock object will ignore the message
4. the computing computation module will then send another remote event with the results of the coputation
5. webapp will receive the response and finish the REST request asyncronously


# Build

```
mvn install
```

# Run

Start webapp module with Payara Micro and then start the computation module with Payara Micro on a different port or machine. You can start more than 1 compuation module, the work will be balanced among them.

```
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy webapp/target/webapp.war
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy computation/target/computation.war --autoBindHttp
```

# Test

To test if all works, access https://github.com/OndrejM/Payara-Micro-Reactive-Example/blob/master/webapp/src/main/java/payara/reactive/rest/AsyncRESTResource.java[AsyncRESTResource.whatIsTheAnswer] via a REST call:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/webapp/rest/async
```
